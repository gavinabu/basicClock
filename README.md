A challenge I gave myself for the smallest possible web clock.\
Currently I have it at 231 bytes but it's definitely possible to shorten more.\
If you want to compete or contribute these are the rules

## Guidelines
1. Your clock must use the following format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM"
2. Your clock must update every second
3. Your text must be centered in the middle of the screen
4. Background color must be "#1a1a1a", and foreground color must be "#ffffff'
5. Font must be "system-ui" with 128px size and bolded(or 800 weight)
6. Size is measured in bytes/characters. Eliminating whitespace is recommended.
7. Your code must be reasonable. Abusing bugs/glitches is not allowed.
8. Your site must be accessable. The site cannot flicker, or only work on certain devices/browsers.
9. Your site must be online. Github pages is recommened.
